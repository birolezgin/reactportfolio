# Description

My professional deployed portfolio displaying a brief bio about me, my GitHub and LinkedIn pages, my resume link, a project page containing some of major projects I have done in the coding bootcamp so far and a contact page includes my email and phone number.

This portfolio created using React.js, Bootstrap and CSS.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
